# git-manage
Git-manage is a tool built on bash that allows you to manage multiple repositories at once.

### Features
- Run a command in multiple repos at once.
- [TBA]

### How to use:

- Download `git_manage.sh` from the latest (or whichever) release in the releases tab.
- Put it in a location that isn't likely to change
- Run `git_manage.sh`.

### Next potential updates:
- Have a set of commands be ran instead of one.
- Have more than one set of repos to be managed. Example: `Set 1: git_manage, cool_repo.` `Set 2: epic-repo2, Best-repo-ever.`
- This tool may potentially be converted to python for windows support.
